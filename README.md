Project Objective:
This project aims to analyze customer churn by identifying key factors that influence customer retention. Using data analytics and machine learning, we will uncover patterns in customer behavior, helping businesses take proactive measures to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

Key Steps in the Project:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, outliers, and formatting data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualizing trends in churned vs. retained customers.
Feature Engineering â€“ Creating meaningful variables to improve predictive accuracy.
Predictive Modeling â€“ Using logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or machine learning models to predict churn.
Insights & Recommendations â€“ Identifying strategies to improve customer retention.
ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used:
Excel â€“ Initial data analysis and visualization
SQL â€“ Querying customer data for insights
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn) â€“ Data analysis and predictive modeling
Power BI/Tableau â€“ Interactive churn dashboards
